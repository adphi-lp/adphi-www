#### 4:00pm-6:00pm: Puzzle Hunt

#### 6:00pm-7:00pm: The Original Steak and Lobster

50 years have passed since the inception of our famous Steak & Lobster dinner, oft stolen but never done justice. Come and partake in an MIT tradition, our semicentennnial dinner; mountains of steak, lobster, and bibs will be included!

#### 1:00am-3:00am: Infinite Crepes

Where do all these crepes come from? How are we able to have infinite crepes given finite resources, means of production, and space? The world may never know.
