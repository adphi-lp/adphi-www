#### 12:30pm-2:00pm: Games Galore and Gobs of Food

We've got the only two things that you need for rush and life: food and games. Come to ADPhi and kick off rush the right way by engorging inane amounts of food and binging on games all day.

#### 2:00pm-4:00pm: Sushi!

Still hungry? Great, we've got enough sushi to throw down your eating hole for days.

#### 4:00pm-6:00pm: Frozen: Liquid Nitrogen Edition

Do you want to dip foods into liquid nitrogen? Come to ADPhi and be immersed in an MIT-type winter kingdom.

#### 6:00pm-7:00pm: The Original Steak and Lobster

50 years have passed since the inception of our famous Steak & Lobster dinner, oft stolen but never done justice. Come and partake in an MIT tradition, our semicentennnial dinner; mountains of steak, lobster, and bibs will be included!

#### 7:00pm-8:00pm: Improv Comedy

Have a penchant for humour? No? Then come to ADPhi and try yourself against one of Boston's best improv comedy troupes, we guarantee you won't make it out without at least a snicker. *note: those with a sense of humour are also welcome

#### 8:30pm-10:00pm: Neon Ultimate Frisbee

It's dark so the day is over, right? Wrong! Come play ultimate with glow-in-the-dark frisbees to cap off the first day of rush.

#### 10:00pm-1:00am: Underground Capture the Flag

As the perennial torchbearer of traditions during rush, ADPhi is proud to present yet another rendition of our infamous, campus-wide capture-the-flag game. Run through tunnels and stairs with hundreds of your classmates in MIT's biggest event.

#### 12:30pm-3:00pm: X-treme Trampolining

Come explore your fetish for extremities by trampolining everywhere, from the walls lined with trampolines to the infinite expanse beneath you which you can jump on forever.

#### 3:00pm-5:00pm: Pirate Battle on the Charles

We all came to MIT for one reason: to become pirates. Bring your wooden leg and annoying bird and we'll supply you with a boat, some booty, and enough water power to take down a frigate.

#### 7:00pm-10:00pm: Indoor Skydiving

We wish we could throw you off a plane, but we've got the next best thing: a 150 mph wind tunnel for you to perpetually fall in.

#### 7:30pm-9:30pm: Ramen Run

Don't worry, contrary to the event name there won't be running of any sort going on since ramen is quite a fulfilling immobilizer.

#### 10:00pm-11:00pm: Homemade Boba

Come and debate the only important question with the food scholars of ADPhi: are you supposed to eat the jellies in boba or not?

#### 12:00pm-1:00am: Food Fight

We all have cafeteria aggression, but rare is the time and place where you can actually throw a chicken leg at someone. Join the resistance, exert your aggression with mashed potatoes and whatever else you can get your hands on. Food will also be provided for those not interested in purely throwing food around.

#### 1:00pm-3:00pm: Paintball

Alas, blessed and cursed be those who cannot be the hero of a Battlefield-like narrative. Luckily we have the next best thing: a game of paintball for you to dominate and be the true hero that this country deserves.

#### 4:00pm-6:00pm: Kayaking on the Charles

Few things in life compare with the breathtakingly gorgeous scenery that a tootle on the Charles gives you. Come and kayak from sunny light to the onset of sunset.

#### 7:00pm-9:00pm: Card Game Night

Think you got what it takes to win ADPhi's annual poker tournament? Come face the brothers of ADPhi and see if you have what it takes to take home the grand prize.

#### 9:00pm-10:00pm: Infinite Crepes

Where do all these crepes come from? How are we able to have infinite crepes given finite resources, means of production, and space? The world may never know.
