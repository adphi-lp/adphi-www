<h2> Spring 2023 Rush Schedule </h2>

<h3> <i> Sunday, 2/12 </i> </h3>

<h4> 6:00 PM: Superbowl Party </h4>
Come chill with Bros of ADP as we enjoy a delightful spread of wings, nachos, pizza and other food, as we cheer on our favorite football teams.
  
<h3> <i> Tuesday, 2/14 </i> </h3>

<h4> 7:00 PM: Powerpoint Karaoke </h4>
We have a ton of slides but we do not know what they are about - all we can guarantee is that we are going to sip on some smoothies and have a laugh about it.

<h3> <i> Thursday, 2/16 </i> </h3>

<h4> 7:00 PM: Kannoli and Kant </h4>
Have you ever stopped and wondered why we exist? Do we have free will? Why is there something rather than nothing? Come join us as we ponder life's great questions and consume inconceivable quantities of cannoli. Kant wait to see you here!

<h3> <i> Saturday, 2/18 </i> </h3>

<h4> 9:00 PM: Casino Night </h4>
Can you keep a poker face? Come try your luck at the tables of ADP :) Food and prizes await!

<h3> <i> Monday, 2/20 </i> </h3>

<h4> 7:00 PM: Miracle Berries </h4>
What do lemon, vinegar, and grapefruit all have in common? They taste oh-so-sweet. That's right, sweet â€” come find out how ;)

<h4> 9:30 PM: Movie Night </h4>
Take a break from studying and immerse yourself in a world of wonder and adventure as we kick back and watch a movie. And don't worry about overpriced snacks, we've got you covered!

<h3> <i> Wednesday, 2/22 </i> </h3>

<h4> 7:00 PM: Board Games and Psets </h4>
The semester is underway, and we know those psets are starting to pile up.  Whether or not you've got a whole pset due at 11:59, or you've got time to spare, ADP's in-house library is the place to be!  Take advantage of personalized office hours with our Olympiad-winning upperclassmen, or take a break and enjoy our equally award-winning board game collection.   Be sure to stay for the ping-pong tournament!

<h4> 8:30 PM: Boba! Boba! Ping Pong! </h4>
Do you love boba a lot? Do you crave more Ping-Pong in your life? Do you want to combine two activities centered around balls? Fret not! We're hosting a Ping-Pong tournament complete with Boba-making to quench both your thirst and your competitive spirit.
