<h2> A letter from our president: </h2>

<p>
After your first semester at MIT, you realize that things can be tough without support. However, with all the classwork, research, and extracurriculars, it seems like no one has any time to give you a hand when you need it. Now - what if I told you there’s a community where its members are dedicated to each other’s continued success and improvement, while also finding time to have fun in each other’s company? <b>That’s where the <span style="color: green">Alpha Delta Phi Society</span> comes in</b>.
</p>
<p> 
At the <b><span style='color:gold'>Lambda Phi</span></b> Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi Society, we strive to support each other’s personal, social, and academic goals through bond of siblinghood. Even as we adapt and add new pages to our story, this mission has remained. Maintaining a diverse group of cultures and backgrounds, and most recently spreading into diversity of gender, we’re able to exchange new perspectives and grow as a collective. Even though we each come from different paths, <b>we are all connected by our shared experiences at Lambda Phi</b>.
<p>
Wondering what you can expect to experience as a sibling? Well maybe you’d like to hike a mountain with fellow sibs on our retreats, have a great time while being dripped out at our formals, perform your favorite songs in our house band, or discuss an interesting read at a book club. Maybe you’re ambitious and decide to run for our many officer positions, gaining valuable experience running an organization, and directly shaping the house according to your vision. Or maybe you would just enjoy the company of your siblings while working on PSETs in our lounges or chatting over dinner. No matter how you decide to spend your time with us, the most important thing is that you’ll always have a place to call home, both during your time at MIT or visiting as an alumnus. So, if you’re interested, swing by 351 Massachusetts Ave. and meet the siblings of the Alpha Delta Phi Society. <b>Find out what it means to be a member of our family</b>.
