<h3>Welcome!</h3>

If you're reading this, chances are you're a freshman looking to learn more about ADPhi. As one of MIT's largest and most successful fraternities, the MIT chapter of Alpha Delta Phi has thrived over the past 4 decades at our historic <a href="/location.html">Mass Ave home</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Also known as the "Lambda Phi" chapter, our house boasts a friendly and passionate group of brothers from all interests and backgrounds. As a "literary fraternity", Alpha Delta Phi believes in developing the whole man: morally, socially, and intellectually, and while we're still just as much engineers as the rest of MIT, we try and emphasize our creativity and leadership more than the traditional MIT student.

However, the most important aspect of Alpha Delta Phi is our strength as a brotherhood and as a family. More than anywhere else on campus, I felt that Alpha Delta Phi was a place where I could grow into the man that I would become and have a group of brothers who would support and encourage me the whole way, no matter which way that was. I'm happy to say I made the right choice.

*Alec Heifetz, LP '16, President*
