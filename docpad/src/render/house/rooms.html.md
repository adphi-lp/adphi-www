Our rooming situation is another fairly unique aspect of ADPhi.

Unlike most houses and dorms which require most members to live in doubles, triples, or quads, all of our rooms are singles!

We have 53 rooms, spread over five floors of one to three halls per floor and around four rooms per hall. Each hall has its own newly-renovated bathroom, and each floor has a large lounge which brothers use to study, socialize, and relax at all hours of the day. The third and fourth floors are primarily residential, while the first, second, and fifth floors have a number of other <link>specialized rooms</link>.

Every room on a floor has its own unique name and character, and most rooms are duplicated between floors, so you'll often hear Brothers refer to something like the "5th kirby" or the "3rd hex". A brief description of each room's layout and history can be found below.

<b>North Hallway</b>

Kirby: The largest rooms in the house, Kirbys are often the most desirable rooms due to their size and prime location near the floor lounge. Originally named something different, the room was renamed to the Kirby when Paul Kirby (Pledge Class "Climax", '92) lived in the room for so long while doing a PhD that some say his ghost still haunts the floorboards. Current residents: Alex Siegenfeld (3), Scott McDonald (4), and our RA Andrew Cuoco (5)

Middle: The most boringly-named room in the house, Middles are located in between the Kirby and the North Fireplace and are the second-largest room in the house with a walk-in closet and view of Mass Ave. Once, while Matt Ferraro (Pledge Class "Flood", '12) was out of town, some brothers decided to "remove" Matt's room by building a layer of drywall over the door frame and painting over the drywall to match the surrounding frame. Matt eventually tore down the drywall, but not before walking back and forth a few times past the wall where his door used to be with a very confused look on his face.
