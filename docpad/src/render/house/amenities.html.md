We are extremely fortunate in that our house boasts a huge variety of specialized rooms and amenities. One of our house traditions is for the newest pledge class to do a "Pledge Project" in which they are given free reign and a budget to create a permanent improvement to the house. Most of the rooms below are the result of one or more pledge projects. The remainder were either created by individual brothers or financed through generous donations by our <link>Alumni Brothers</link>
